# @flexible/ui

FlexibleUi provides accessible and complex components without any preconfigured styling.
A custom style for each project can be applied with any css framework you like.

This library is meant to solve the usual business requirements like forms with validation, inputs and pagination without
locking you into fixed design systems.
